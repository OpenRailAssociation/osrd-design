# osrd-design
Documenting how the OSRD Design System and its rail network tools were designed, in an effort to explain why any given item ended up with this specific shape and behaviour.

Each building block is described using the same facets:
- **intent**: context and goals for this component,
- **anatomy**: all the component parts that may appear during its life cycle, size variants when it applies,
- **interactivity**: how the component communicates its availability to the user,
- **user expression**: what the user can do with the component to communicate with the application,
- **application feedback**: how the component communicates updates to the user,
- **layout**: how the component should be arranged relative to others in a screen.
