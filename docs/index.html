						<p>The design process doesn&#8217;t rely on any specific design method. It&#8217;s based on the experience of designers working on the project. Here is what we&#8217;ll do: listening to stakeholders and users, taking notes, clearly understanding the context (project, users) and the tasks to be handled by the app, using interaction and information display best practices, reviewing and comparing exhaustive design systems, and running qualitative tests with users.</p>

						<p>OSRD should reflect its prospective and industrial nature. It belongs in a library, an engineering office or a workshop, rather than in a shopping mall or a candy store. Aesthetics and behaviour will be used to convey this.</p>
						<p>The flat design trend allows for very elegant and minimal interfaces. But it also makes it harder for interactive elements to appear so. In this project, we&#8217;ll be adding a little more depth and presence when visually rendering buttons, input fields and such, so they can better be distinguished from content at a glance.</p>

						<h3>Accessibility</h3>
						<p>OSRD will be a complex tool by nature, with a large amount of informations to display at once to make it effective to those who will work with it. Sufficient contrast in colours and comfortable active zones for interactive elements will have to be used as much as possible, while ensuring rich semantics are visually expressed and that sufficient efficiency is reached by users on the target screen size.</p>
						<h3>Discoverability</h3>
						<p>OSRD is an industrial tool, not a public facing website where users have to figure out every task at hand on their own. The axiom <em>&#8220;UX is like a joke; if you need to explain it, it isn&#8217;t that good&#8221;</em> doesn&#8217;t apply in such context. Still, we must do everything we can to figure out smart and obvious ways for users to accomplish their tasks.</p>
						<h3>Longevity</h3>
						<p>Complex interfaces take a fair amount of time to be designed, and a redesign is costly. OSRD should remain usable and pleasant to use in 2033 and beyond. We&#8217;ll rely on as much timeless aesthetics as possible, and steer away from any 2023 cool graphic gimmicks.</p>
						<h3>Independence</h3>
						<p>As an Open Source project financed by the European Union, OSRD doesn&#8217;t have pre-existing brand guidelines to work from when orienting its visual langage. It should not be associated with any particular European rail operation company graphic identity, and remain on a neutral ground. Starting out without any guidelines can be paralysing, but it gives us wiggle room to design a tool we&#8217;re going to love to work on.</p>

						<h3>Vertical</h3>
						<p>Just as with ruled paper, having text and elements evenly placed and dimensioned vertically provide visual harmony and eases eye parsing, reducing tiredness over time.</p>
						<p>The 8px increment is widely used, as it can provide meaningful line heights for text, distinctive icon sizes, and comfortable interactive elements dimensions. It&#8217;s also very much rooted in computation, which makes it even more pleasant to settle on and set rhythm with.</p>

					<div class="text">
						<h3>Role in the interface</h3>
						<p>Colours provide semantic clues to users, so consistent use is key to provide a streamlined experience. They complement text labels and layout to inform users about the context they&#8217;re in, about what they can—can&#8217;t—should—shouldn&#8217;t do, and can be used to organise efficiently complex sets of informations.</p>
						<p>Tools like OSRD are mostly made of text content, so colours play a major role in providing meaning before users take the time to read every label.</p>
						<h3>Common issues</h3>
						<p>Colours are culturally subjective, within a region or a company, they can&#8217;t be semantically neutral.</p>
						<p>Colours are not physiologically perceived the same way by everyone (colour-blindness, age,…).</p>
						<p>Colours are not mathematical, and variants can&#8217;t be computed and used for good results. Contrasts are not equal from one tint to another at the same saturation and luminance values.</p>
						<h3>Palettes</h3>
						<p>Colour palettes are not just a container where to pick references, they&#8217;re also a design tool to ensure visual harmony.</p>
						<p>Design systems sometimes provide a handful of colours to work with, sometimes many more variations for each tint. OSRD Design System will follow the latter situation and provide 10 variants for each tint (except for ambients and utilities), which by experience allows for more flexibility while maintaining consistency on the long term.</p>
						<h3>Variants</h3>
						<p>Variants are distributed from very light to dark. Their numbering pattern from 0 to 100 follows the clever one <a href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-tokens/color/overview/" title="really worth the read" target="_blank">described by USWDS</a> which has the benefit to provide a colour accessibility shorthand: if the difference in grade between two colours exceeds 50, WCAG 2.0 AA contrast is achieved at 16px font size.</p>
						<small class="artboard"><a href="img/Colours/Accessibility_tests@2x.png" title="design document png export" target="_blank">View text accessibility tests artboard</a></small>
						<h3>OSRD specifics</h3>
						<p>The brand-less nature of OSRD provide a truly open field of possibilities in colour use, compared to most situations where colour have to reflect a brand and a set of values.</p>
						<p>For example, the primary colour used in prominent interactive elements is usually derived from the brand colour. We&#8217;ve decided to reference the <a href="https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/web-design-history/tim-berners-lee-created-the-first-website-1991">early days</a> of the web and went for a nice tint of blue.</p>
						<h3>References</h3>
						<h4>Ambients</h4>
						<p>OSRD is made of four distinct areas. To make it instant for users to know in which area they are, and to identify a topic from a given area in another one, four different ambient tints will be used: blue, beige, green, and violet.</p>

						<h4>Greys</h4>
						<p>Greys can be neutral, based on black only. Or they can feature a small amount of tint and get a warmer or colder tone.</p>
						<p>Greys are very important as they are used for almost text content, icons, and to structure screen layouts. They really do impact the mood.</p>
						<p>To set a warm and welcoming tone, we’re choosing to add a bit of orange. If this proves to be a limitation, we can add another set of colder or neutral greys later on.</p>

						<h4>Primary</h4>
						<p>The primary colour of an interface is often chosen to reflect the brand colour. By design, OSRD doesn’t have a brand, so we’re left with a wide open choice.</p>
						<p>To reflect the open source and web based nature of OSRD, we have decided to use a dark and intense tint of blue, reflecting the colour of links in the early days of the web.</p>

						<h4>Utilities</h4>
						<p>These colours are used to convey information, success, warning and error messages in all situations. We'll follow the convention to use a blue for information, a green for success, an orange for warning, a red for error, and a yellow for the highlighter. Having a tint for highlighting purposes has also proved to be handy.</p>
						<p>Each tint gets 4 variants: they allow to adapt the visual presence of the messaging elements to their correct hierarchical position in the screen.</p>
						<p><p>The 30 variant was set first: this is the colour that will be used to fill icons, or as a border. Eye-catching while not too saturated, compatible with the calmer visual context we&#8217;re trying to create.</p></p>

						<h3>Role in the interface</h3>
						<p>Just as an actor provides <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptations_of_Sherlock_Holmes#Film">a face</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_and_television_series_featuring_Robin_Hood">to a</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_in_film">fictional character</a>, a type<em>face</em> provides a specific form to words composing an interface, and participates actively in the app&#8217;s mood. Just as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Bautista">Dave Bautista</a> would be an offbeat choice to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilbo_Baggins">Bilbo Baggins</a>, choosing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_(typeface)">Impact</a> to lay out an old style tea label would prove to be a regretful decision.</p>
						<p>The other role of typography is to produce meaning by modulating text attributes such as size, letter-spacing, decoration, weight, layout, etc.</p>
						<h3>Picking a font</h3>
						<p>Before this design effort started, OSRD used two fonts in its incarnations: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sans">Open Sans</a> in the project presentation website, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenir_(typeface)">Avenir</a> in the app itself. The former has been evaluated against other candidates, and the latter – coming from SNCF&#8217;s design system that was successfully used to begin work on the interface – has been discarded, as it did not fit the brief.</p>
						<p>Picking a font for a project like OSRD is engaging in a long relationship. You might as well be clear about what you wish for to avoid future regrets.</p>
						<h4>Design brief</h4>
						<p>Here are the attributes that were sought after when selecting candidates:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>open source font</strong> to fit the nature of the OSRD project;</li>
							<li><strong>typographic excellence</strong> to guarantee visual harmony, eloquence and clarity in all situations;</li>
							<li><strong>great legibility</strong> at small sizes to support deep information hierarchy in complex screens;</li>
							<li><strong>at least three weight variations</strong> with italics to broaden visual expression;</li>
							<li><strong>monospaced variant</strong> is a plus for raw data display;</li>
							<li><strong>serif variant</strong> is another plus to have a fitting second voice at hand, if needed;</li>
							<li><strong>neutral</strong> to existing European railway operator graphic identities;</li>
							<li><strong>technical</strong> rather than literary, yet <strong>vibrant</strong> rather than emotionless.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Font candidates</h4>
						<p>Here are the font candidates that were found and evaluated:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sans">Open Sans</a></li>
							<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overpass_(typeface)">Overpass</a></li>
							<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Plex">Plex</a></li>
							<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roboto">Roboto</a></li>
							<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Sans">Source</a></li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Evaluation</h4>
						<p>To gauge and compare the performance and fitness of each candidate, a template of text samples with various characteristics was set up:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>title in 32pt bold</strong> | <em>contrast with regular weight, legibility and harmony</em>;</li>
							<li><strong>uppercase short labels</strong> in 18pt semibold, often used for action buttons | <em>contrast, legibility, footprint</em>;</li>
							<li><strong>lowercase short sentences</strong> in 18pt semibold, often found in titles and short messages | <em>contrast variation with regular and bold weights, legibility</em>;</li>
							<li><strong>short labels</strong> in 16pt regular, representing the bulk of texts in interfaces | <em>personality, clarity, harmony, distinction between uppercase I, uppercase L, and lowercase L</em>;</li>
							<li><strong>a few lines</strong> in 12pt regular, captions and details | <em>legibility</em>;</li>
							<li><strong>4 digit numbers</strong> with thousands separator for tabular data | <em>availability, legibility</em>;</li>
							<li><strong>longer text</strong> in 16pt regular, using the serif variant if possible | <em>availability, reading comfort</em>.</li>
						</ul>
						<small class="artboard"><a href="img/Font/Candidates@2x.png" title="design document png export" target="_blank">View font candidates artboard</a></small>
						<p>Each text sample was then rated from 0 to 5, and the candidate with the highest sum of grades was therefore the best fit for the brief.</p>

						<h4>Selected font</h4>
						<p>And the winner is… <a href="https://www.ibm.com/plex/">IBM Plex</a> font family. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Plex">wikipedia</a>:</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>IBM Plex is an open source typeface superfamily conceptually designed and developed by Mike Abbink at IBM in collaboration with <a href="https://boldmonday.com" title="Dutch type foundry website" target="_blank">Bold Monday</a> to reflect the design principles of IBM and to be used for all brand material across the company internationally. Plex replaces Helvetica as the IBM corporate typeface after more than fifty years, freeing the company from extensive license payments in the process.</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>About the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/innovation_explanations/article/mike-abbink.html">open source nature</a> of Plex:</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>Abbink says there was much debate about keeping IBM Plex strictly for in-house use, “but we realized that to have Plex as part of all IBM experiences, we needed to make it an open-source typeface. If a shoe store or coffee shop decides to use the IBM typeface in their identity system, that’s a cool story. They’re tying their identity to ours.
